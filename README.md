# Etch-A-Sketch
For this project, i will be creating a sketch pad with some functionalities such as chaning the color of background when mouse is hovered over the canvas. Add a button that when clicked will prompt users to choose the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
i will probably be using the stuff i have learned so far, including flexbox, event listners, basic css styling and creating elements such as div tags using JS. 
should be fun.
